### Setup instructions

**R** and **RStudio** are separate downloads and installations. R is the
underlying statistical computing environment, but using R alone is no
fun. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes
using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install R before you
install RStudio. After installing both programs, you will need to install the
**`tidyverse`** package from within RStudio. Follow the instructions below for
your operating system, and then follow the instructions to install
**`tidyverse`** and **`RSQLite`**.
